# Gaming Site with Responsive design
 Used bootstrap framework for layout design and responsiveness
#
<h2>Initial steps</h2>

<p>
 I used npm install to install the bootstrap flies to the website directory. Then I linked the necessary files to the html file.
 I tweaked a few styles on the css file that was manipulated by bootstrap's classes. I did not add classes on to my already existing html tags.
</p>

<h2> Possible improvements</h2>

<ul> 
     <li>Make use of bootstrap classes to simplify and improve my css code.</li>
     <li>Add some improved dynamic styling to the store's buttons that it shows the svg code for the specific stores.</li>
     <li>Add some more genre buttons and improve the styling to suit the other buttons. </li>
 </ul>
